## TURTLE CHASE  

A cartoon word association game.

## Purpose  

This is browser game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and jQuery). The game was built as part of the Sparta Global IT consultant graduate scheme, as a week long project.  

## Functionality  

The game was all built on one html page, with six individual div screens. The divs consisted of an introduction page, three level pages, and a win and a death screen. 

There are five linked CSS files for the different divs, and one full of the animation codes. Additionally, there is a JavaScript file containing all the logic.

The gameplay involves reading the randomised clue at the top of the level page and the associated number. The number refers to the number of words on the game board that are related to the clue. The player is tasked with making the right connections and choosing them to advance their green character bar, and progress to the next level. Each correct click gains the player one point. On each correct click, there is a 35% chance to spawn an additional clue in a side board panel. On ending their turn, or by clicking an incorrect or wrong answer, the computer will randomly choose one of their clues to become red and advance their red bar. If the player chooses a word belonging to the computer, the computer will advance once for that click, and then again as part of it's own move. Clicking a computer word will also subtract one from the player's score.  

As well as the computer starting one step ahead, hidden in the words on the board there exists instant death words, that will end the game and present the death screen if clicked.  

The player wins by making all of the correct associations and correctly guessing all their words before the computer for three rounds.
